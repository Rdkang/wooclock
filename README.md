> A command-line opinionated clock program written for my needs

## Installation

To build wooclock, you'll need to have Rust installed on your system. You can install Rust by following the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Once Rust is installed, you can download and compile the wooclock program by cloning this repository and running the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rdkang/wooclock
```

```bash
cargo build --release
```
This will compile the wooclock program and create an executable file in the `target/release` directory.

## Usage

To use wooclock, simply run the executable file with no arguments to get the possible options or with `--help`:

```shell
./wooclock
```
